You can contact our support desk any time that you have a question, notice an error, or feel stuck. Here are some different ways that you can get in touch:
<ul>
 	<li>Email: Send an email message to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a></li>
 	<li>Website: Click on the main menu, and then click on “Help &amp; Feedback.” A widget will appear where you can fill in a feedback form.</li>
 	<li>Live Chat: Launch a chat session by opening the main menu, and then clicking on “Chat Live with us.” The link will only appear when somebody is available to chat, which tends to be during normal business hours.</li>
</ul>
When you contact our support desk, your question is stored as a ticket. You can review the tickets you’ve opened by logging into our support site at http://eduguide.freshdesk.com.
