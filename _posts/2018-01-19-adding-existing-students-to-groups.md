After students have joined your team, you can organize them by adding them to multiple groups.
<h2>From the Members Management page</h2>

Click on “Members” in the sub menu for your team which will be located inside the main navigation menu. Once you are on the members page, locate the student you would like to add to a group, and then click on “Add to Group” located to the left side of the student’s name. A checkmark will appear next to the names of groups that the student already belongs to. Clicking a group name will add or remove the student from a specific group. You can also add a student to a new group by entering in the group’s name in the field marked “New Group,” and then hitting enter. Upon submitting, the group will be created, and the student will be added to it.
<h2>From the Groups Management Page</h2>
<h3>Navigate to a Group’s Edit Page</h3>
You can access a group’s edit page from the group management page. Click on the “Invite Members” button next to a group’s name under the Pending Groups header, or under the other headers click on the name of the group. For pending groups, you will be taken to the group’s invite page. On that page, click on the button “View List.” For the groups which were displayed under the other headers, you will be taken directly to the group’s Edit page.
<h3>Switch to the Add Students Mode</h3>
<i>If you landed on the Group’s edit page from the Invite page, you will taken to the Edit Group page with the Add Students screen already shown. You can skip to the next step.</i>

Upon landing on the group’s edit page, click on “Add.” The view of members will switch from current members of that group to a full list of all members on the team.
<h3>Add/Remove Students</h3>

Click on the button next to each student’s name to either add or remove them from the group. When you are done, click on the “Done” button to save the changes and switch to the view mode.
