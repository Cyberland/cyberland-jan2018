Each student who joins your team will automatically receive a 20 activity subscription. They can complete the activities at their own pace, although it is recommended that they average about one activity per week. This gives them the chance to reflect on the information given, and think deeply about their responses. Also, it gives them the chance to respond to their coaches’ comments.

The system will alert them once they’ve completed all 20 activities. They will be asked to view their path journal, choose activities they would like to repeat, and revise or update the responses they’ve left in the comments.

Contact the helpdesk if you feel that your student has been shown this message prematurely, or if you suspect that there is a bigger issue. We are available during business hours for live chat, or you can send us a message via the “Help &amp; Feedback” link in the main navigation menu.
